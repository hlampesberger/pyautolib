# pyautolib

## Representations of regular languages in Python

The library implements some of the grammatical inference algorithms listed in Colin de la Higuera, Grammatical Inference: Learning Automata and Grammars, Cambridge University Press, 2010. There are also drafts for automata for regular tree languages and visibly pushdown languages.

The code has not been ported to python3 yet and is basically unmaintained.

Rendering of automata is done by graphviz directly ("dot" command has to be available in your environment).

pyparsing is required for regex parsing.
